                We were asked to design something for reducing the environmental impact of human activities.
                <br><br>
                We initially identified fast fashion but through preliminary research we discovered that the core issue
                in that space was the pace of consumption and waste being produced.
                <br><br>
                We decided to scope down to consumer waste, discovering the activity of Upcycling and the culture of DIY
